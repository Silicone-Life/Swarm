# Swarm
Uses blocks to do something meaningful.

1. A simple example would be a set of drones that have been tasks to find insurgents in a government building. These will work together in harmony to figure out the situation and report findings back to the HQ. 
Those that monitor the actions will have a chance to initiate counter-offensive ops.

2. A swarm of mining robots that will autonomously drill through a asteroid, constantly spectrophotometrically scan everything they find on their path and report back to the mothership. If we are interested in what we find, mothership can either capture the rock or send another drone to bring rare minerals home. All thanks to the blocks. 

3. A swarm of radio receiver sattelites in suns' geostationary orbit and with a constant distant from earth will constantly scan the universe in 360 degrees to find habitable planets. Each of these will be capable of filtering out background noise and report only the planets back to the surface. Or if found, work together to take a peek at the planet and send information back to earth.

4. A self driving car which uses a swarm of blocks to make sense of the world and navigate safely and make sound decisions. Note: An experienced human CAN drive any car with just one eye open safely in the traffic without hearing others. (I tested this by myself). So all we need is just ONE camera, and previous knowledge which is pretty easy to obtain.

5. A swarm of devices working together in a robot body. Each device has it's own memory/functionality but able to take in overridable commands from the core.

6. A swarm of agricultural devices working together in a green house to minimize resource usage and maximize yeild. Comes in handy during long range space flights and space colonisations.
